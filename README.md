# SQL Window Functions

This workflow defines a function to get the maximum sale amount for a given product, a stored procedure to calculate the total sales for each salesperson, and a window function to rank salespeople based on their total sales.

Window functions are a powerful tool for performing complex calculations and analysis on your data. They can be particularly useful when working with large datasets, where it would be inefficient or difficult to perform these calculations using traditional SQL queries.
